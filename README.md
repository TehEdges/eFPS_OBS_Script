## üöÄ Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.12 (Windows 64-bit) is installed and configured for OBS scripting.
2. Copy the script (`efps_sf_obs_control.py`) into your OBS scripts folder or any other folder:
   - Typically located at:  
     `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\data\obs-plugins\frontend-tools\scripts`
3. In OBS:
   - Go to **Tools > Scripts**
   - Click **+** to add a new script
   - Select the script file
4. Enter your **SF API token** into the provided field.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

| Option             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **SF Token**       | Your API token for accessing the SF Streamer Overlay. |
| **Center Overlay** | Whether to center the overlay in the browser source. |
| **Delay**          | Delay in seconds before displaying events. This should match the SourceTV Delay. |
| **Server List**    | Choose the server whose overlay should be loaded. |
| **Overlay Source** | The OBS browser source to update dynamically. |

---

## üì¶ How It Works

1. The script queries the SF API endpoint for online servers.
2. You select the desired server from the dropdown.
3. The script builds a URL and updates the selected browser source in OBS.
4. Any change to the overlay config (server, center, delay) automatically updates the source URL.
